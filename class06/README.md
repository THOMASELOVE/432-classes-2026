## Announcements

1. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-minute-2026) should be available **by class time**.
2. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/lab3.html) is due Wednesday 2026-02-04 at noon, to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). We remind you that you will need to have ingested your [Project A data](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/projA.html) into R to complete part of the Lab.
3. Please complete reading [How To Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) by class time next Tuesday 2026-02-03.
4. Another very good weekend activity is [updating your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), which I try to do about every two weeks.

## On Non-Linearity

Here are a few articles related to using non-linear terms in regression models that may be of interest to you...

## Reminders 

1. Today, we mostly close our work on the [HELP](https://www.mosaic-web.org/mosaicData/reference/HELPrct.html) trial.
2. Today's material using Spearman's rho-squared and "spending" degrees of freedom, as well as `ols()` vs. `lm()`  functions is mostly covered in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), especially in Chapters 13 and 14.
3. Frank Harrell's books on biostatistical modeling, highlighted in the [Class 4 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2026/tree/main/class04#announcements) are your best source for follow-up beyond our Notes.

## One Last Thing

<https://discourse.datamethods.org/> is "a place where statisticians, epidemiologists, informaticists, machine learning practitioners, and other research methodologists communicate with themselves and with clinical, translational, and health services researchers to discuss issues related to data: research methods, quantitative methods, study design, measurement, statistical analysis, interpretation of data and statistical results, clinical trials, journal articles, statistical graphics, causal inference, medical decision making, and more." It is sponsored by Frank Harrell consulting.
