## Announcements

1. The slides posted for Classes 7 and 8 are enormous (224 slides), and will be discussed (at least) in classes 7 and 8. My effort there is to try to provide a logistic regression example which "covers" material from many different aspects of regression modeling.
    - Here is [an outline](outline.md) of the material discussed in these slides, which also includes [an index of key statistical topics discussed](outline.md#index-of-r-functions-and-key-statistical-ideas).
    - The **support1000 example** on our Shared Drive includes many things from these slides, plus other materials.
    - In Classes 9 and 10, we will be working through a similarly detailed example, involving linear regression.
2. This week's data comes from the [favorite movies data gathered in 431 this past Fall and in prior years](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/movies). The version on our 432-data page is an Excel file, [downloadable here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/raw/refs/heads/master/data/movies_2026-02-01.xlsx).
3. We won't get to it until Class 8, but there is an extra file of 50 more movies, as a .csv, also on our 432-data page, [downloadable here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/blob/master/data/movies_extra.csv).
4. More to come.

## Today in "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

- Jeff Leek on "[How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)"
- Shannon Ellis and Jeff Leek's publication (2018) [How to share data for collaboration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7518408/). *The American Statistician*.

### On Data Sharing...

1. It is really hard to create a serious, research quality data set in almost any scientific discipline.
2. Data should be made available when papers are published. The question with reproducibility isn't "if" anymore, it is "how".
3. The transition toward reproducibility is likely to be rough.
4. Data sharing isn't easy and it isn't cheap.
5. Not knowing how to share data isn't an excuse - to be a modern scientist, this is one of the skills you have to have.
6. The culture of credit hasn't caught up with the culture of science.
