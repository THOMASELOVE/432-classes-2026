## Announcements

1. The slides posted for Classes 7 and 8 are enormous (224 slides), and will be discussed (at least) in classes 7 and 8. My effort there is to try to provide a logistic regression example which "covers" material from many different aspects of regression modeling.
    - Here is [an outline](outline.md) of the material discussed in these slides, which also includes [an index of key statistical topics discussed](outline.md#index-of-r-functions-and-key-statistical-ideas).
    - The **support1000 example**, on our Shared Drive includes many things from these slides, plus other materials.
    - In Classes 9 and 10, we will be working through a similarly detailed example, involving linear regression.
4. Today's data comes from the [favorite movies data gathered in 431 this past Fall and in prior years](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2025/tree/main/movies). The version on our 432-data page is an Excel file, [downloadable here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/raw/refs/heads/master/data/movies_2025-10-28.xlsx).
5. We won't get to it until Class 8, but there is an extra file of 50 more movies, as a .csv, also on our 432-data page, [downloadable here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/blob/master/data/movies_extra.csv).

## Some Thoughts motivated by "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

- <https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv> has an array of attractive CV templates, and I have used a free account at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to maintain my CV and other items for years.
- Dr. Sherri Rose's thoughts on [Academic CVs for Statistical Science Faculty Positions](https://drsherrirose.org/academic-cvs-for-statistical-science-faculty-positions)
- Each of my courses (431, 432 and 500) are designed in large part: (a) to teach you a wide range of technical skills (both about statistical thinking and coding in R) and (b) to dump as much of the practical experience I have into your head as quickly as I can.

### On Paper Writing...

1. Write clearly and simply even though it may make your papers harder to publish.
2. No one will care about your grades in graduate school but everyone will care what you produced.
3. It is important to publish results that aren't surprising or novel.
4. The first thing to do in writing a paper is not to write, but instead to create a set of 1-4 publication quality plots, and show them to someone to make sure they "get" your story before proceeding.
5. An important thing to work on in graduate school is your own internal times that tells you "OK, we have done enough, time to write this up."
