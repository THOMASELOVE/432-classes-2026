01 | 2026-01-13 | **[Slides 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2026/slides01.html)** | **[PDF 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2026/slides01.pdf)** | **[Code 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides01.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- Some people may find the PDF version of the slides (with 2 slides per page) easier to take notes on.
- The Code link provides the Quarto code I used to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

You can do this. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.

## Getting Help

If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it. ASK FOR HELP. To get help in this course, you have three main options:

### TA Office Hours will start Friday 2025-01-16

Attend TA office hours to get one-on-one help or share a computer problem. TA office hours are held via Zoom, and will begin on Friday 2026-01-16, and continue through Thursday 2026-04-30, except for Martin Luther King Day (Monday 2026-01-19) and Spring Break (hours are cancelled from 2026-03-07 through 2026-03-13.)

Zoom information to join these sessions is posted to our **Shared Google Drive**. 

### Email us at 431-help at case dot edu

Notice that's **431-help**, not 432.

### If all else fails...

Email Professor Love at `thomas dot love` at `case dot edu` with any individual concerns related to the course that you do not feel comfortable asking elsewhere, or if you have any special concerns or needs that you want him to know about, or to set up an appointment with him for a Zoom meeting. I will also hold “drop in” hours for as long as necessary after each class. Just let me know that you want to talk with me at the end of class.
