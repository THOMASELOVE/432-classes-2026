## Today's Slides

Class | Date | HTML | PDF | Quarto | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :-----: | :------: | :-------------:
02 | 2026-01-15 | **[Slides 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2026/slides02.html)** | **[PDF 02](slides02.pdf)** | **[Code 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2026/slides02.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- Some people may find the PDF version of the slides (with 2 slides per page) easier to use.
    - After clicking the PDF link, hit the **download** button at the top right of the screen to save the `.pdf` file.
- The Code link downloads the Quarto code (.qmd file) I used to build the slides.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## Announcements

1. Today's class has been moved to Zoom. See your email for the Zoom information.
2. My intention is to discuss [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/projA.html) in some detail in class 3 but I'm happy to address questions about it (especially via **431-help at case dot edu** at any time.
3. Thank you to those of you who have completed the [Welcome to 432 Survey](https://bit.ly/432-2026-welcome-survey). If you haven't done this yet, then please do it today.
4. Remember that [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/lab1.html) is due at NOON on Wednesday 2026-01-21. Submit the work to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - There was a small typo (`hs_grad` instead of `hsgrad` in the list of variables) in Lab 1, which is now fixed, thanks to an alert student.
5. TA office hours begin **Friday 2025-01-16**. Zoom details *and* the complete schedule are available on our **Shared Google Drive**, and on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - Remember that we won't hold any office hours this Monday 2026-01-19, because of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday.
6. All 432 (and 431) materials remain online until 2026-06-01. In May, you will want to download (and keep for yourself) anything you want to have after that date.

## Another Course

from Abdus Sattar (sattar at case dot edu):

> I am writing to invite you to enroll in **Machine Learning and Data Mining** (`PQHS 471`) for Spring 2026, a 3-credit course focused on practical, hands-on machine learning with Python using real biomedical and clinical datasets. We will cover core supervised and unsupervised learning methods (including clustering, PCA, regularization, tree-based models, support vector machines, and deep learning) with an emphasis on interpretation and communication of results. If you are interested in applying modern data-driven methods to biomedical, clinical, or public health research, please review [the PQHS 471 syllabus](471_syllabus.pdf) and [flyer](471_flyer.pdf) and consider registering for PQHS 471.
> Today's 471 class will be on Zoom: to visit, go to <https://cwru.zoom.us/j/95669647661>. Meeting ID: 956 6964 7661. Passcode: 424142

## What should I be working on?

1. [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/lab1.html) is due next Wednesday at noon to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). To do the Lab, you'll want to have installed/updated all of [the necessary software](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/software.html).
2. Read through the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/), and familiarize yourself with the other materials on [our website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/), especially the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
3. The [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2026/projA.html) are available, and I would read them soon, so you know what you need to be thinking about.
4. Ideally, you'd also be reading [How to be a modern scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which you need to finish by the end of January. It's almost ten years old now, but it still has a lot to offer in a small package.
